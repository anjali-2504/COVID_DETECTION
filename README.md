# COVID_DETECTION
* This ipynb files contains the code to a Convolutional Neural netowrk model which is fine-tuned on the Covid cxr Kaggle dataset.
Please find the link to the dataset below.
[Covid CXR dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2)
* The pre trained Resnet Model has been used to extract the global features and the upsampled data has been fed into the model.

* The trained model has the accuracy of 93% on test data and 95% accuracy on the training data set. Find the model here in the [Link ](
